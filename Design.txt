Assignment 6 Design:

Under the main easy animator package, there are three sub-packages for
animation, model, and shape.

shape package contains:
- Shape interface (Downloaded from canvas)
- AbstractShape class (Downloaded from canvas)
- Oval class (Downloaded from canvas)
- Rectangle class (Downloaded from canvas)
- Point2D class (Downloaded from canvas)
- ColorNames enum - uses the awt Color package and stores the value as a Color
  and the text as the string representation of the color. We also include all
  of the permissible color values (can be expanded on in the future).
- TypeOfShape enum - we use this instead of instanceof for certain methods
  that require information on what type the Shape is.

animation package contains:
- Animation interface - outlines all the methods required for a shape to become
  animated
- AbstractAnimation class - implements the Animation interface and its methods
- ChangeColor class - extends the AbstractAnimation class and contains methods
  needed to make a shape change color in time
- Move class - extends the AbstractAnimation class and contains methods needed
  to make a shape move in time
- Scale class - extends the AbstractAnimation class and contains methods
  needed to make a shape move in time
- TypeOfAnimation enum - we use this instead of instanceof for certain methods
  that require information on what type the Animation is.

model package contains:
- Model interface - outlines all the methods required to store and handle
  shapes and their respective animations
- ModelImpl - implements the Model interface and its methods
